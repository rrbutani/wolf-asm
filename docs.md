# Machine Language

The assembly language you can compile and run on the machine.

Taking inspiration from RISC-V, the machine language instruction set is very
limited. It can be extended by adding various modules in the form of additional
hardware or extra CPUs.

## Considerations

* Register machine or stack language? Or something else?
* Turing complete?
* Limited memory
* Limited registers (if register machine)
* System calls
